Every note has a number id and a title text as subject of note. 3 size of headers can be in content and all selectable texts can be formated as bold, italic and underline. Also you can insert a link or image in every place of note you want, image can be online link or a file:// link to a local image. Specially for developers and programmers Axinote supports code blocks which makes it easier to take notes about code. You can create lists to manage everything better (lists are in notes and just support text). Also labels are for grouping notes which will be automatically added under search input.

The searching process is in advanced level :) you have two options when searching. The button near search input is for switching search mode, which can be * or +, * means (any used word in search input be in note, the note will be accepted) and + means (all used words in search input must be in note then note will be accepted)
